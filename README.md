## What it Does:
This code performs Euler's Method and Runge-Kutta Method for the function t-y^2. 

## How it works:
The functions are coded under main/assignment_3.py. I then call the functions in test/test_assignment_3.py.

## Running the Code in the Console:
For running the test file, cd into the folder that contains both main and test folders and use "python -m test.test_assignment_3".
